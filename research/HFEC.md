## Abstract

Modern forward error correcting (FEC) codes with high-performance
iterative decoders are of tremendous interest in the wireless
communications research community. On the practical side, these codes
have already been adopted in many wireless communication standards and
are under consideration in numerous future standards. The widespread
use of these codes places tremendous importance on decoder design and
implementation. The goal of this research is to develop hardware FEC
decoders that are efficient in their use of hardware resources and
implementation effort. While our approach is quite general and is
widely applicable, we focus on low density parity check (LDPC) codes
and serially concatenated convolutional codes (SCCC) as design
examples.

## Use of Functional Programming

The KU FPG lab implemented the LDPC algorithm using Lava, an estabished
techneque for representing curciuts.
