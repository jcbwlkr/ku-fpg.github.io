**Walkarusa** is a Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) library
that support synthesis for embedded controllers, including
Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 

Why Walkarusa?
Technincally, Walkarusa is a deep embedding of FRP, using
a varient of the popular Yampa API.
Yampa, a shallow embedding of FRP,
is named after the Yampa river, which is known for being
shallow, though treatruous in places.
Walkarusa, a river in Kansas, translates to "deep river".
Hence, Walkarusa, a deep embedding of FRP.
