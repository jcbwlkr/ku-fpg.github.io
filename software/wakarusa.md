**Wakarusa** is a toolkit for connecting DSLs.
It provides support for synthesis to CUDA for execution of GPGPUs,
synthesis to VHDL to execution on FPGAS, and
synthesis to C for execution on embedded controllers, including
the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The capabilities are provided
via a plugin interface, and Wakarusa provides a resources-aware 
infrastructure for allowing staged development of remotely executable
artifacts.

The first public release of Wakarusa is scheduled for Spring 2015.

There is also a [project centric](/research/wakarusa/) webpage about wakarusa.
