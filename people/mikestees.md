##Mike Stees

I am a second year PhD student with Dr. Gill.  My research interests include programming language design and high performance computation.  In particular, I am interested in high performance functional programming.  My exploration of techniques for high performance has primarily focused on leveraging parallelism, but I have also looked at using optimizations like Worker/Wrapper to improve peformance.
